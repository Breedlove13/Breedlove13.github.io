My real interest started after I lost my last job to nepotism. Then I started thinking about which direction I wanted to go in life. My older brother is a software engineer and has mentioned how they hire people coming out of bootcamps all the time. They have a great starting salary and benefits, also theres a huge market for software engineers. 

Another really big draw for me, is that it gives me a chance to create something of my own, maybe even eventfully start my own business. Software Engineering gives you so many crazy opportunites, and I want in on those opportunies.
