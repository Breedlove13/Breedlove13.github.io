I am here to build a better future for myself. I currently work in call cent/ customer center but that not where I want my furutre to be. i wasnt to create, to make something of my own. To have the ability to start my own business to have the freedom to move to new jobs without worry, to take on new and interesting challenges. 

Right now, I'm mostly just focused on learning as much as I can right now lol.
